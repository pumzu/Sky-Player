# V4 Release Authority

V4 has a separate public release authority:

```text
pumni/Sky-Auto-Player-Releases
```

The source repository `pumni/Sky-Auto-Player` remains the legacy v3 release
namespace. The v4 Rust `UpdateService` has exactly two compiled metadata
endpoints:

```text
stable: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pumni/Sky-Auto-Player-Releases/main/channels/stable/latest.json
beta:   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pumni/Sky-Auto-Player-Releases/main/channels/beta/latest.json
```

These URLs are selected by Rust from the persisted channel setting. They are
not supplied by React, environment variables, command-line arguments, or a
GitHub Releases fallback. The dedicated repository may remain without either
`latest.json` file until the first qualified v4 promotion; a missing endpoint
therefore fails closed.

## Canonical published asset

The Windows package uses the actual Tauri NSIS output and has one updater
asset/signature pair per release:

```text
Sky Auto Player_<version>_x64-setup.exe
Sky Auto Player_<version>_x64-setup.exe.sig
```

The immutable release URL is derived from the exact version and filename:

```text
https://github.com/pumni/Sky-Auto-Player-Releases/releases/download/v<version>/Sky%20Auto%20Player_<version>_x64-setup.exe
```

No portable ZIP, v3 `MANIFEST.json`, alias filename, source-repository
release, or signature URL is valid v4 updater metadata. The `.sig` field in
metadata contains the exact text from the published Tauri `.sig` file.

## Deterministic metadata

`cargo xtask release-authority generate` accepts only qualified-release
inputs: the canonical SemVer version, normalized release notes, a
second-precision UTC RFC3339 publication date, the exact
`windows-x86_64` Tauri platform, the immutable asset URL, and the exact
signature file. It emits the official Tauri static JSON shape:

```json
{
  "version": "4.0.0",
  "notes": "...",
  "pub_date": "2026-09-04T00:00:00Z",
  "platforms": {
    "windows-x86_64": {
      "signature": "<contents of .sig>",
      "url": "<exact immutable asset URL>"
    }
  }
}
```

`cargo xtask release-authority validate --channel stable|beta` validates the
same bounded contract. Stable accepts only final SemVer releases; beta is
explicitly a prerelease channel. Stable and beta are separate destination
paths: `channels/stable/latest.json` and `channels/beta/latest.json`. The
validator rejects v3 URLs, non-HTTPS URLs, other owners/repos, query or
fragment state, SemVer build metadata, malformed dates, extra platforms, and
non-canonical artifact names.

The packaged qualification path emits a bounded
`tauri-nsis-qualified-release` evidence object containing the canonical
version/name/size pair and SHA-256 digests for both the installer and `.sig`,
  plus `unsigned-zero-budget` Authenticode-state evidence and SPDX SBOM references/digests.
  The installer is truthfully recorded as Authenticode-unsigned.
`qualified=true` is not accepted by itself: the promotion gate rejects missing
  or extra fields, `test` or other non-governed Authenticode modes, malformed evidence, digest
mismatches, and same-name assets with different bytes. Metadata promotion is a separate operation after the
immutable release has been published and the exact published assets have
passed qualification. It compares GitHub's asset digest when present, or
downloads and hashes the exact canonical asset when the API omits a digest.
The promotion action copies only the validated generated file into the
selected channel path; it never creates placeholder production metadata and
never rebuilds or replaces a published binary. Stable promotion cannot write
the beta path, and beta promotion cannot write the stable path.

The repository-owned acceptance check
`scripts/ci_v4_release_authority_acceptance.ps1` is read-only. It verifies
that the public source repository's `/releases/latest` is still a published
v3 release with its canonical v3 assets and that the dedicated authority is a
public repository. It does not create, upload, publish, edit, or delete any
release.

`scripts/promote_v4_metadata.ps1` is the separate promotion gate. It requires
the bounded evidence emitted by the packaged qualification path, runs the Rust
metadata validator, reads the dedicated repository's published release and
exact installer/`.sig` pair, and compares names, sizes, and SHA-256 digests
against the qualified bytes before atomically copying metadata into the
selected channel path in an authority checkout. Its `-SelfTest` regression
path proves arbitrary `qualified=true` evidence and same-name/different-bytes
assets are rejected. The dedicated v4 release pipeline invokes this validator
only after it has published the immutable draft, then writes the validated
channel file through the bounded authority credential. The promotion helper
itself never creates, edits, replaces, or deletes a GitHub release asset.

The dedicated authority must have GitHub immutable releases enabled before
the first production transaction. `ValidateAuthority` checks both the
existing `refs/heads/main` bootstrap and the repository's immutable-release
setting; `PublishDraft` and `FinalVerify` require the returned release object
to report `immutable=true`. Assets are uploaded only through the
release-specific `upload_url` returned by the create-release response, and a
duplicate-name/upload error is never repaired by deleting or replacing an
asset. Any post-draft qualification failure therefore requires a new
SemVer/RC.

## Release pipeline and authority bootstrap

`.github/workflows/release-v4.yml` is the only production v4 publication entry
point. It is manual, runs on the dedicated/single-tenant Windows runner, and
uses `V4_RELEASE_AUTHORITY_TOKEN` for release/assets/channel metadata writes.
The source `GITHUB_TOKEN` and OIDC permissions remain separate and are used for
source-bound attestations. The updater private key is not a GitHub secret: the
production workflow does not accept a key-path input and reads
`V4_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` only from dedicated runner-local process
configuration.
The authority token contract is bounded to the dedicated repository only, with
the minimum Administration read and Contents read/write capability needed to
inspect immutable-release policy, create/read/publish release records, upload
release assets, and write `channels/<channel>/latest.json`; it has no
source-repository, Actions, secrets, package, or updater-key permission.

The pipeline first requires `refs/heads/main` in this repository. An empty
authority repository therefore fails closed with an instruction to perform a
separately reviewed one-time bootstrap. That bootstrap must create the minimal
authority `main` history (including the channel directory contract) outside a
production release dispatch. A release dispatch never creates the first
authority commit as a side effect.

The project's production release policy is `unsigned-zero-budget`: no
Authenticode provider credentials are required; an
optional real-signer seam is separately governed and is not represented as
current production evidence. The retired v3 updater is preserved by Git
history and the `v3-maintenance` line, but is not part of the current v4
workspace or product graph.

The v4 Tauri updater public trust root is committed independently of this
release-authority metadata contract. Its operational private key remains
outside the repository. The post-download fixture bridge trusts `[old,new]`
and verifies the exact downloaded candidate bytes during `Update::download()`;
the production candidate itself is not rebuilt by that qualification. A full
non-PR workflow dispatch is required for provenance and SPDX attestation
evidence.
